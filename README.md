# healthesy
A Flutter based mobile app to help individuals track their health. 
Among other features, users can enter general health information, create notes in regard to symptoms, medical conditions, 
incidents and other, and get reports created based on what the app knows about their health.

_Only health related features, no tracking or anything else. You can build your own version, and 
deploy to your own device._

Anyone is welcome to send pull requests for new features, documentation, bug fixes, or anything else that is 
valuable for the App and its users. 

_All pull requests will be perused before being accepted._
